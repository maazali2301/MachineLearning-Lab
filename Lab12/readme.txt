LINEAR REGRESSION

1) For the given dataset implement gradient descent from scratch and find the linear relationship
between features and output

2) Write a code that finds out the relationship between two linear arrays eg
  o Input array x=[1,2,3,4,5,…]
  o Output array y=[3,5,7,9,11,…]
  o The code should work for any given input/output, use gradient descent.
  
3) Is linear regression good for classification? If yes, then why, and if no, then why?

4) Why do we use mse (mean squared error) over squared error? What is the benefit of mse?

5) Can you find a better estimator than mse?
